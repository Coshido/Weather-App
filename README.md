# Weather-App

TOP project with html, css and vanilla JS. The aim of the project is to get used with Async/Await.
I had problems using npm date-fns package without using webpack, so i went for a cdn version.
I think I'll rewrite the project using webpack and using modules.
Also I believe I can shorten the render code by using better naming conventions and using loops to
generate DOMs and assign values.
